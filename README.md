Simulation demonstrating fixed, variable partition allocation and fifo page replacement schemes using React.js 

The memory allocation schemes are implemented in es6 style javascript classes located at:
./os-concepts/src/data_structures

You can use the various main.test.js files located at each of the folders as guidelines
Or
You can run tests which would show some output, to do so, use the following steps:

Install npm and node for linux mint:
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs npm
   sudo ln -s "$(which nodejs)" /usr/bin/node
   sudo npm install -g bower
   sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
Navigate to ./os-concepts/ :
  run the following commands:
    npm install (would install the various dependencies for the project)
  to run the tests :
    npm test
